## 🧩 Overview

This project implements a **full cloud security pipeline** combining deception technology (Cowrie honeypot), threat telemetry ingestion through **Microsoft Defender/XDR connectors**, **Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM)**, and cloud-native **SOAR automation** using Logic Apps.

> 🎯 **Goal:** Automatically enrich Sentinel incidents with real-world attacker data collected from an internet-exposed honeypot.

This reduces analyst triage time and surfaces actionable threat intelligence with zero manual effort.

## 🚀 High-Level Flow

```text
Internet Attackers
        │
        ▼
Azure VM (Ubuntu) running Cowrie (ports 2222/2223)
        │  cowrie.json logs
        ▼
Azure Monitor Agent (AMA) + Data Collection Rule (DCR)
        │  custom table (Cowrie_CL_CL)
        ▼
Microsoft Sentinel (Log Analytics Workspace)

## 🎯 Project Objectives

✅ Deploy an Internet-facing honeypot to collect attacker telemetry  
✅ Route security events into Microsoft Sentinel  
✅ Generate incidents from suspicious behavior  
✅ Automate enrichment inside the incident response workflow  
✅ Demonstrate **SOAR and Cloud Security Engineering** skills  
✅ Showcase an **end-to-end defensive architecture**

---
💡 Why This Matters
---

Security analysts handle dozens of alerts per shift. Automating triage saves valuable time by immediately adding context like:

🔁 Repeated attacker IPs

🌎 Geographic clusters

💥 Brute-force attempts

⚙️ Automated scans and probes

This playbook automatically:

**1.** Extracts entities

**2.** Loops through each indicator

**3.** Filters by type (IPs)

**4.** Formats a triage summary

**5.** Posts results into the Sentinel incident comment pane

✨ Impact: Small automation, huge SOC efficiency gain.

🛠️ Azure Deployment Steps
---
Full details in `docs/02-azure-setup.md`

**1. Create the VM**

**OS:** Ubuntu LTS  
**Size:** B1s (sufficient for testing)  
**Authentication:** SSH Key  
**Public IP:** Static


**2. Configure NSG Rules**
| **port**        | **Purpose**    | **Protocol** |
|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
| 2222            | Cowrie SSH     | TCP          |
| 2223            | Cowrie Telnet  | TCP          |

⚠️ Warning: Never host a honeypot inside private or production networks.

🎣 Deploying Cowrie (Docker)
---
```text
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y docker.io
sudo systemctl enable --now docker

sudo docker run -d --name cowrie \
  -p 2222:2222 -p 2223:2223 \
  cowrie/cowrie:latest

# View logs
sudo docker logs -f cowrie

```

📥 Log Ingestion to Sentinel
---

- Install Azure Monitor Agent (AMA)

- Create a Data Collection Rule (DCR) targeting ```/opt/cowrie-data/cowrie.json```

- Output to a custom table: Cowrie_CL_CL

Example validation query:
```
Cowrie_CL_CL
| take 5
```

🔔 Analytics Rule (KQL)
---

Detect repeated attacker attempts and create incidents automatically:

```text
kql

Cowrie_CL_CL
| extend Ip = coalesce(src_ip, tostring(src_ip_s))
| summarize AttemptCount = count() by Ip
| where AttemptCount > 5

```

📄 Template: `analytics/cowrie-incident-rule.json`

🤖 Sentinel Playbook (Logic App)
---
This Logic App parses incident entities, loops through indicators, extracts IPs, builds a summary, and posts it back into the incident.

🧩 **Workflow Steps**

**1.Trigger:** Sentinel incident

**2.Get incident details**

**3.Parse JSON:**

- **Content:** ```@{triggerBody()?['Entities']}```

**4.Initialize variable:** ``summary`` (String)

**5.For each entity:** ``body('Parse_JSON')``

**6.Condition:** ``toLower(coalesce(item()?['Type'], item()?['$type'])) == 'ip'``

**7.Append to summary:**

```concat('• IP: ', coalesce(item()?['Address'], item()?['IpAddress']), '\n')```

**8.Add comment:** ```variables('summary')```

📝 Example Output (Incident Comment)
---
```
• IP: 185.220.101.8
• IP: 103.21.244.1
• IP: 45.133.1.12
```
✅ Validation Checklist
---

🏁 Conclusion
---

This project captures real-world attacker telemetry, forwards it to Sentinel, and enriches incidents automatically — demonstrating an end-to-end threat detection and automation pipeline built entirely on Microsoft Azure.

💡 From honeypot to SOAR — every alert now tells a story. "This pipeline directly inspired HydraSec — a multi-head AI threat intelligence platform built to make those stories explainable."
